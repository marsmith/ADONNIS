# ADONNIS

## Purpose
The motivation for the ADONNIS Project was to improve the process of creating new identification number and names for new water guages. Prior to the creation of this software, creating new IDs and names was a timely process that was done visually and had the potential for error. ADONNIS advances the site naming and numbering process by using weighted networks and a proportional site naming and ID numbering algorithm which increasing the accuracy and efficiency.
